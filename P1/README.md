First Project from Data Analysis NanoDegree

The file contatns my final work as P1.pdf. I also added the python code that I used to do the plot and to process the data.
This code can be used to any set of statistical test that is dependent, such as longitudinal, pre and pos test and time tests. 

As an input, it needs the data as a csv on two colunms. The alpha level desired and the type of t-test (one or two tailored).
The output is the null hypothesis result, descriptive statistics (mean and std), inferential statistics(t critical, t value and p value)
Also, it generates a plot of the normalized histogram with the probability density function of the distribution for both tests.
